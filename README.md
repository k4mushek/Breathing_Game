Rules of using GitHub repo:
  1. Work only in your branch
  2. Discard any changes you made not in your branch
  3. Name your commit properly (feature/asset + short progress description)
     3.1 You can describe your commit in the "Description" window below 
  4. If you want to try something new, create a new branch from yours
  5. Do not merge anything by yourself!
  6. To merge something (no matter from testing branch to your branch or from your branch to main) contact the git master
  7. Do not revert your commits before asking a git master

How to make a branch:
  1. Open a branch list
  2. Click "New branch"
     2.1 If you are not in main branch, you will be asked on which branch it will be based on
  4. Make a name for your branch (it should be represantive for a feature you're going to work on)
  5. Click "Create branch"
  6. Click "Public branch"
